**Prompt (Enhanced & Detailed):**

> I have two React component files that are responsible for rendering games, but currently the UI lacks a strong visual identity or theme. I want you to completely revamp the styling and layout to give it a **game-centric look and feel**, specifically drawing inspiration from aesthetics like:
>
> - **Cyberpunk**: Neon lights, high contrast colors, glows, futuristic fonts
> - **Metallic/Futuristic**: Steel textures, gradients, holographic UI elements, dark themes with electric accents
>
> The goal is to give users an immediate sense that theyâ€™re in a **gaming environment**, not a basic or generic web app. Think along the lines of what you might see in a game launcher, esports dashboard, or a sci-fi game menu.
>
> Requirements:
> - Use a consistent and immersive **color palette** (e.g., neon purples, blues, teals, or metallic silvers and dark grays)
> - Integrate **UI components** that resemble gaming UIs: buttons, cards, menus, hover/focus effects
> - Add **stylistic effects**: gradients, subtle animations, glowing borders, etc.
> - Use modern styling libraries or frameworks (like Tailwind CSS, styled-components, or CSS modules) to implement clean and scalable styles
> - Ensure it looks good across screen sizes (responsive design)
>
> Bonus if:
> - The UI has animated transitions (e.g., hover interactions, loading effects)
> - Fonts and icons are styled to match the theme (maybe import a tech/futuristic Google font)
